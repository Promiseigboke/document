### What is Jurisprudence?
This is the science, philosophy of law. There is no exact definition of Jurisprudence. Different jurists define Jurisprudence in their own way. It can be analytical or descriptive.

### Legal Personalities
This is a person who has the rights or duties to perform. A person who can sue and be sued.

Two types of Persons:  
1. Natural  
2. Artificial / Juristic  

Under Common Law, Legal Personalities are assigned by law. E.g. a woman, children, slaves were not legal persons, and were said to derive their personalities from another. A woman from her husband or slave from the master.

Every person (natural) is a legal personality. This was established by the Berlin Conference.

Legal Person is any subject matter (whether human or not) to which the law attributes rights and duties to perform.

Hence, a legal person has real existence, but its personality is fictitious.

Personification is essential for all legal personalities, but personification does not create legal personalities. Based on that, Paton W. & Derham D.P.A. 1972 - observed that legal personality is an artificial creation of law. A particular device by which law creates units to which it ascribes certain powers.

In a historical sense, the human being is therefore not "ipso facto" a legal person unless and until such recognition is accorded them. e.g. women, slaves were regarded as chattels.

Legal Personalities may be granted to other things other than natural persons e.g. a group of persons, idols, foundation, fund. It therefore rests with the law to confer, withdraw or deny legal personality to any person or entity.

Legal Persons are real and imaginary beings to whom personality is attributed by law by way of fiction where it does not exist in fact.

Today, under modern law, every natural person is a legal personality.

### Legal Personalities (Continued)
Artificial Persons:  
- Corporation Aggregate  
- Corporation Sole  
- Juridical Persons - Unincorporated persons under artificial persons e.g. friendly society, Partnership; are legal personality.  

- Artificial persons can be corporations and unincorporated companies  
- There are things under statute that are given legal personalities.  

- Corporation - These are incorporated companies. Divided into Corporation Aggregate and Corporation Sole  

Corporation Aggregate is independent, made up of different persons. These are all companies that are incorporated under CAMA, that are independent from the members.

Corporation Sole: The Person as a sole person is independent of the registered office. e.g. The Bishop is different from the office of the Bishop which was registered.  

* The stool (Office of the Stool) remains forever while the occupant changes.

### Nature Of Legal Personality
A natural person becomes a legal person once he/she is born and it ends once he/she dies, that is, such person has the capacity to sue and be sued; and also has rights and responsibilities.

NOTE:  
* Onus of Proving that he/she is a legal person lies on he who says he is a legal person by bringing such statute that makes him a legal personality.  

It is trite law that the entities that have legal personalities in law have the right to sue and be sued. This is stated in Common Law. Thus in the English case of Knight, Celery v Dove....  

In determining Civil rights and obligations of parties.  

Legal Personality as a concept of law and its applicability goes to the jurisdiction of the court.  

- Juridical Personality is not the same as Juristic Personality. e.g. Trade Union  

* Juristic Persons mean legal Persons according to Prof Uju.  

The court in Fawehinmi v NBA by Apaye JSC  

### Persons Who Can Sue And Be Sued In Law
These are juristic persons and have been recognized to include:  
1) Natural Persons  
2) Corporations  
3) Companies incorporated under CAMA  
4) Corporation aggregate  
5) Corporation Sole  

The unincorporated associations that are given legal status by statute are Trade Unions, Partnership, Friendly societies, Sole Proprietorships.  

See Tyne Medical Merchandise V Pfizer Inc & anr (2001) 10 NWLR Pt 422.  

Corporation Aggregate is defined as a collection of individuals united into one body under a special denomination having perpetual succession under an artificial form and vested by the policy of law with the capacity of acting in several respects  

In Partnership, each partner can sue each other or the partnership in their own names.  

### Proof Of Juristic Personality
He who asserts that he is a legal personality has the onus to prove by going to the statute that says he is.  

### LEGAL PERSONALITY AND ACCESS TO COURT
11th November 2025 - Prof. Uju Nwogu  

Legal Personality and Access To The Court.  

Sec 6(6)(b) of the CFRN 1999 - This preserves the right of access to the court and the right of citizens to approach the court.  

In Registered Trustees PAW v Registered Trustees AAC, it was held that generally no court has jurisdiction to hear any matter in which either the plaintiff or defendant is not a legal person. The jurisdiction to entertain a matter is decided by the constitution.  

See Anambra State Govt v Nwankwo - A required pre-action notice of 3 months must be given.  

Note!  
- The objective of the enquiry whether or not a person has legal personality is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction ; and not a denial of access and where either of the party has no legal personality.  

see Madukolu v UAC  

### LEGAL PERSONALITY AND LOCUS STANDI
Locus Standi - The standing of a person to sue someone who has sufficient interest to sue in a matter.  

The legal personality of a person relates to the legal recognition of a person to sue and be sued, while locus standi relates to the standing of a person to sue after he has been accorded legal recognition.  

The issue of legal personality is determined first before locus standi is.  

See Bank of Baroda v Iyalabani - It was held that while legal personality relates to the very existence of the plaintiff, locus standi relates to the existence of the right of that plaintiff as a natural or artificial person.  

Lack of locus standi and legal personality by a plaintiff will lead to the matter being struck out.  

### Advantages Of Incorporation
1) Ability to acquire, hold and dispose of property as a unity or group  
2) Perpetual succession  
3) Ability to sue and be sued in its corporate name without the need of joining the members  
4) Ability to carry on business with limited liability  
5) United common interest of a large number of people  

### Theories Of Corporate Legal Personality
1) Fiction Theory  
2) Realist Theory  
3) Symbolist Theory  
4) Bracket Theory  
5) Concession Theory  
6) Purpose Theory  
7) Kelsen Theory  
8) Organism Theory  

Fiction: Proponents of this theory: Salmond and Savigny. According to this, juristic persons are treated as if they are persons. This is the most popular among all the theories due to its non-involvement in metaphysical and political matters.  

REALIST THEORY: This theory asserts that juristic persons enjoy real existence as a group. These look at things from the real school of thought. To these people or theorists, it must exist in law and also in fact. Exponents of this theory are Gierke etc.  

SYMBOLIST THEORY: According to this theory members of a corporation and beneficiaries of their foundation are the only real persons. Juristic personality is only seen as a symbol to achieve the goal of a group. The use of 'person' is used only for natural human beings.  

Here it simply means that the members of the group are seen as real persons and not the group itself.  

Hohfeld's Theory: Here, Hohfeld drew a pure distinction between human beings and artificial juristic persons. Juristic persons to him are a creation of arbitrary rules of procedure. According to him, only human beings have the ability to make claims and have power. To him, a corporate person is a  

Purposive Theory: This is based on the word 'Person' is only accorded to human beings. Juristic persons are not persons at all. Juridical relations are only accorded to human beings. Juristic persons are subjectless things/properties. The theory assumes that other people (natural) may hold duties towards subjectless properties, without the subjectless properties having corresponding claims. This means that companies don't have any rights or duties whatsoever. He says companies are <Juristic / Artificial Person>.  

ENTERPRISE ENTITY THEORY: This theory to an extent is related to the purpose theory. The extent of liability is determined by the underlying enterprise. However, looking at the nature of corporation as stated by the theory determines or shows the attitude of the law towards incorporation of company. It can be described as utilitarian theory.  

CONCESSION THEORY: The main feature of a juristic person is a legal personality which is determined by the state. The determination of juristic personality is a question of law under this theory. It purports the general view of Natural and artificial persons.  

Organism Theory  

This is closely associated with the realist theory. It states that groups are persons because they are organisms like human beings. However, it is quite preposterous to even consider a corporation as human beings because they don't have life.  

### Criticisms Of The Theories
1) They are not so much concerned with finding a permanent solution to the issue of legal personality.  
2) None is comprehensive in itself.  
3) Some of them are analytical (Kelsen Theory)  
4) Lawyers have not limited themselves to any of these theories, they use all depending on the subject matter.

### Concept Of Legal Duty
Generally, concepts are formed from the epistemological progression of the consequences of that concept.  

Duties are those that are created and have sanctions gotten from rights.  

Concepts are also formed by experiences people encounter, or even consequences of concept.  

Intellectual concept formation of concept: when someone has various conflicting information of something, the human mind leaves out all those information and picks out the common thing they all have.  

E.g. A boy who has tasted several types of beans.  

Note: Contact is first done with our senses.  

Legal Concepts are tools of legal reasoning.  

Prof. Keenan: Duty is an act or forbearance compelled by law, and it must be in respect of a right vested in another.  

The Command (former) came to forbearance, while the new one came by acts. The former stated more when a person was a governor would be brought he is not expected to be arrested as with a police force as a government may even lead to the death of the person, while the new one states that the usual should be reached immediately.  

John Austin Stated that legal duty is action or forbearance of acts commanded by a person who has power to make such command. Here, the command or forbearance is implemented by sanction. <This is the difference between the former definition> The Criminal Code makes use of this definition.  

Oliver Wendell Holmes. He opposed the view of John Austin. He stated that duty does arise as a result of a command, the command is an expression in a style of a command. It is not a command as if there is a commander. He stated that it is actually a psychological expression that comes in the style of a command.  

### Difference Between Legal Duty And Moral Duty
1) An example is seeing a child about to fall into a ditch and eventually you don't help and such child falls into the ditch and dies. Here, legally you don't have a legal duty to help such child but a moral duty. This is because it is compelled by our religion or conscience but not the state.  

This is except it is expressly stated by the law.  

2) There are some acts that are both legally and morally duties.  

3) There are sanctions that follow moral duty, e.g. conscience (moral sanctions?)  

3) The concern of the law is precisely for legal duty.  

* When the law acts or forbears, it does so in respect of a right of a person, the next time the law will do so to enforce it.  

* It is because it is commanded by the State that makes it a legal duty and not because there is a sanction for it.  

### Nature of Duty
A duty may be stated strictly as a prescriptive pattern of the law that expresses rational patterns of conduct to which people may or may not comply with.  

Note: Recognition by Law, is the essence of the nature of a duty. Can a law be  

1) The duty represents an official view of how people ought to behave.  

2) Recognition of law is predicated upon the fact that it is commanded by law.  

3) The genesis of the Ought and Ought not patterns of conduct are not relevant as long as it has become part of the law by virtue of case laws, judicial precedents, etc.  

4) The Recognition of law has very strong relationship with provisions providing for.  

5) Once it is recognized, the court will see it as a pattern of conduct.  

Note: However, change in society can change the nature of duty. Duty changes as the society.  

### Theories Of Duties
1) Imperative Theory: This simply means that duties are commanded. Duty comes into being as long as it is commanded by a person or higher authority and imposed on the subject to comply with it. e.g. President to citizens, Doctors to Patients. (Higher to lower authority)  

2) Sanction Theory of Duty: This seeks to base the existence of duty on the sanction attached to it. Even if a higher authority gives a command and no sanction is given then a duty is not existing. Sanction and Duty go hand in hand. Fear of punishment  

3) Acceptance Theory: This is based mainly on the acceptance of the Public. This theory bases the existence of duty on the acceptance of such duty by the community, whose patterns of behaviour the duty regulates. Here the people must accept it. Even if it is commanded by a higher authority/law, and it is sanctioned, but the people refuse to accept it, there is no duty. It exists if duty passes the criteria of existence, then it is accepted.  

Community accepts it or complies with the criteria set out by the same community.  

Note: Find out the criticisms given to these theories.  

The sanction theory criticizes the acceptance theory by saying that if people accept the duty while it has not been sanctioned, how can there be a duty? If it is not sanctioned, people will behave anyhow they want to.  

• A response to the criticism of acceptance theory by sanction is a meta-ethical stance and stated that judges give judgements without sanctions (declaratory judgement). Also, in provisions of statutes, an offence is defined without providing sanctions to them.  

4) Feeling Theory of Duty: Here, there is a relationship between the existence of duty and inner feeling of someone to obey that duty. This theory is related to psychology.  

Basis of the existence of duty: Important Notice.  

Then where does the existence of duty arise? Origin of the impulse of duty. Where it comes from?  

### 16th December 2025 - Fr Maurice
Duty. Feeling Theory  

Emmanuel Kant, Propounder of the feeling Theory. He brought about categorical imperative, also known as the principle of humanity. To him, humanity must always act in such a way that the maxim (principle) of their action can be held in such a way that they are the recipient of that action.  

The theory of feeling of duty asserts that there is an inner connection between the existence of duty and inner feeling of people which compels them to obey the law.  

There is also a criticism for this theory- A Person may not have a feeling to perform such duty, that does not mean that such duty does not exist. e.g.  

Sec 305 of Criminal Code- Penalty for committing suicide.  

The critics say that why say that the origin of duty is feeling here where there is still some sort of sanction that is  

1) Considerable interest is feeling as two separate things  

2) Breaks down to the view feeling  

3) Reducing to obey certain rules set by the state e.g traffic rules. Human beings have reason and will.  

Basic of obedience to actual  

Factors that relate to immediate obedience to duty  

1) Fear basis - Command / Sanctions  

2) Social basis - Linked to Acceptance Theory  

3) Psychological basis - Linked to feeling Theory  

4) Moral Basis - Linked to feeling Theory  

John Austin, stipulated that the fear basis is linked to the sanctions and Command theory of duty. He stated that presence of sanctions compels obedience. The critics say that it is not a formal basis; many obey because they are thus arbitrary without fear of the consequence of not abiding. There are also critics that state that there are duties that are not based on sanction. Fear has no place in some labouries where duties are breached due to accidents.  

2) Social Basis Inter-dependent patterns of behaviour in the society. Behaviour patterns are inter-related. This is linked to the acceptance theory of Durkheim.  

3) Psychological Basis Here, obedience to duty is a psychological reaction. Either there is a fear or a social basis that prevents such person from doing such action. There is a psychological pressure to obey such duties due to the ever present pressure to obey the duty.  

4) Moral Basis Obedience to duty is traceable to the presence of moral obligations on the part of rational persons to obey a particular duty. Here, it is about what you "ought to do" and "ought not to do" This is clear since damages are not sanctioned and where people decide why it is to obey such duty. And may comply with it goes with their moral sensitivity and also based in their conscience  

a. Ratio Decidendi - Reason for the decision of the case  

b. Obiter Dictum - Things said by the way to non-binding judicial comments  

### 16th December 2025 - Prof. Uju Nwogu
Judicial Precedent  

Theories of Judicial Precedent  

1) Classical Theory  

2) Hambaugh Mechanical Theory  

3) American Realistic Theory  

4) Goodhart's Theory  

Classical Theory: Here, the principle which the case is binding authority is to be found in the reasons given by the precedent judge for his decision i.e. what he said. The judge's statement is binding only so far as it is necessary to the decision of the case. An observation on other matters or statements of law are mere obiter dicta and not binding at all.  

Mostly followed by English Courts. The theory does not help in practice to actually identify the ratio. Where the judge gives two reasons for his decision, both are binding. See Jacobs v LCC  

Also consider the facts of the case to consider the reason for the decision  

2) Hambaugh's Mechanical Theory According to this theory to discover the ratio of a case i.e. the reason for which the judge decides the case one should carry out the following:  

i) State the reason why the judge based his decision  

ii) Insert one word that reverses the meaning of the proposition (NOT / or any form of reversal)  

iii) Then ask if the court could have reached the same decision between both parties if it rested on the altered proposition  

If the decision would be same, then the supposed reason cannot be real or the true reason for the decision. The ratio decidendi will not stand.  

Criticism: It is difficult to formulate a proposition of law which can be completely reversed with just inserting one word?  

2) Where there are two ratios, the theory is of no assistance.  

3) Where the ratio is wide the theory will not be applied.  

This theory is generally used by trial judges.  

3) American Realistic Theory: This is divided into two broad groups. They are a) The extreme group: This group rejects the doctrine of precedent altogether. Stating that the judge's statements about being bound by precedent are part of the reason why these judges make decisions the way they make radical decisions or decisions that are not within the provisions of the law.  

b) The moderate Group: Here, the subsequent courts are bound by precedent, but differ from classical theory. According to them, to find the principle which subsequent courts will follow one disregards the reason given by the Judge and bases only on what he does; that is, the decisions between the parties in relation to the facts of the case. Whenever the facts of a later case is similar to the precedent case, one expects the same decision.  

Goodhart's Theory: Here, the principle binding on subsequent courts is to be derived from the judge's decision in the light of the facts which the judge treated as material. Goodhart's theory was between the English and American Theories. The judge determines which part is material and immaterial.  

This is basically the best theory.  

Question: Which of the facts are material as determined by the judge?  

Rules To follow:  

1) Express statement by the judge that certain facts are material or immaterial, and they must be treated as such. Even if the judge in his statement of facts is wrong, then the material facts must be taken as stated by him.  

2) If the judge treats any facts as impliedly material or immaterial, they should be accepted as such.  

3) Where as between material and immaterial facts, there is no distinction possible, all the facts mentioned by the judge are to be treated as being material. The more the facts that are included, the narrower the resultant principle of law will be.  

4) Where several opinions reach the same conclusion but differ on material facts, only those facts held to be material by the majority are to be regarded. (Majority carries the vote)  

5) Where, as between material and immaterial facts stated in the several opinions of judges, no distinction is possible, all the facts mentioned by each of the judges are to be treated as material.  

6) Hypothetical facts, if the judge states a fact hypothetically, such fact is not material and does not influence the principle of the case  

* Goodhart's theory seems to be the most reliable of all theories on how to find the ratio decidendi of a case, yet there is no evidence that judges use it.  

* The theory does not assist in knowing when facts are impliedly material or immaterial  

### Advantages of the Doctrine of Stare Decisis
1) It helps to maintain consistency, stability and a high degree of certainty in the practice of the courts. Example: N. T. Canada.  

2) It saves the judges time and energy since they don't need to trace every point of law in previous cases.  

3) It enforces a welcome uniformity of standards among the decisions among inferior courts, especially  

4) It enhances public confidence in the judiciary that like cases will always be decided alike in like circumstances  

5) It permits the lower courts to refuse to follow a precedent decision of the higher court except the Supreme Court which has been reached per incuriam.  

### Disadvantages Of Stare Decisis
1) The doctrine has the tendency of perpetuating bad decisions and obsolete laws and the fact that a lower court can't refuse to follow a precedent decision of the Supreme Court in a matter that has been reached per incuriam compounds the problem  

2) It is unhealthy in that it prevents lower courts from re-interpreting statutes and thus produces unnecessary rigidity in this area of the law  

3) Judges do make law and not just interpret

Duty  

Note: Exams  

* Consider each basis independently and make your argument on which is the strongest  

* Explain them to show you understand them clearly  

* Having explained them, you can now state one you feel is strongest and then give your reasons  

* Tell him why you think it, for example feel that basis 2 is stronger than the other basis. Make sure you state that and then conclude.  

* Classes of Duty  

* Explain how a universal duty can end up being a particular duty as well  

* A class of duty can fall into another class e.g duty to  

### Classes of Duty
Universal/General/Particular Duty  

In Universal, everybody is expected to perform this duty e.g duties that are for the whole citizens of Nigeria.  

While general duties are imposed on specific classes of persons e.g in Nigeria if all persons are required to perform certain duties to the state, they are universal. But there could be a class of Nigerians doing business or aliens who are in Nigeria that are subject to Nigerian laws. It is not to the entire people of Nigeria but to a particular section of people.  

For Particular Duty, it is a duty that is owed from person to person.  

The Universal is Larger, General is more constrained while Particular is strictly Person to Person.  

For example, the various duties imposed on Nigerians by the 1999 Constitution are all Universal Duties. Every single person is bound by it.  

Duties imposed on aliens (foreigners) who want to do business in Nigeria, all have General duties (they are in class within Nigeria.  

Particular Duties are those duties that arise from specific relations of the law, e.g the duty of care not to allow 3rd parties to suffer damages as a result of one's negligent acts.  

e.g A Doctor owes a Patient a duty of care  

Primary And Sanctioning Duties  

A general, universal or particular duty can be a Primary or Sanctioning duty.  

Primary Duties, these do not arise from commission of wrongs, while Sanctioning is from the commission of wrongs e.g Sanctions given after owing someone  

Primary duties are duties expressible in law which do not arise after a primary duty has been breached e.g. Right of life. This is a general. Sanctioning duties are those imposed as a result of a previous crime committed or as a remedy or way of making up.  

Primary Duties are those that don't arise from commission of crime. They are independent from any breach of duty, e.g. Duty of a Police man to prevent the commission of a felony. See Sec 4 of the Police Act. Duties of a lecturer or a Professor is a Primary Duty.  

But when there is a sanction attached to such duty e.g. When a lecturer or professor collects bribe from anyone, a 2 months suspension is given by the disciplinary committee. The above duty is predicated on the commission of a previous crime/offense.  

Sanctioning Duties on the other hand are as a result of wrongs already committed. e.g an unsuccessful defendant in a civil action has the duty to pay the successful plaintiff his
