# Jurisprudence and Legal Theory Notes (Continued)

## Continuation from Primary and Sanctioning Duties

This is different from duty to pay taxes by citizens. (Primary Duty)

### Absolute and Relative Duties

The Absolute Duty is an all-encompassing duty. It is quite different from Universal. These duties do not have corresponding legal rights. They are independent of any legal right existing to protect any legal persons, e.g., Duty not to commit suicide. No other person is concerned. Human beings are Natural Persons. Also, Duty not to harm animals are absolute duties because animals are not seen as legal persons. They are duties that are absolute in every term. The ones we question "What is the right to which these duties are attached?"

Relative Duty: To every right, there is a corresponding duty by the next person not to do anything that will threaten such a right. (If there is no right standing between/before them, there is a right standing between/before them. Here, this duty is relative to a right.)

(Page 2 is blank or continuation not provided in text.)

It also ensures that owners have the duty to respect that entitlement.

### Definitions of Right by Jurists

Jurists have attempted to define right. Prof. Allen defines it as a legally guaranteed power to realize an interest.

Hohfeld - an enforceable claim to performance by another.

Rights is an interest in respect for which there is a duty, disregard of which is a wrong. J. Salmond.

Ademola & Yakubu - legal rights are those rights conferred on an individual by rules of positive laws which are enforceable through society approved institutions such as the courts or the police.

### Characteristics of Legal Rights

* Point of Inherence - if the right is vested in me, I am the party of inherence.

* Party of Incidence - the person or other factors as a duty to respect the right.

Right must be vested on a person (party of inherence)

2) There must be another person bound by duty to respect the right (party of incidence)

3) There must be an act or forbearance to which the right relates. (subject matter of)

In Right to life, the subject matter is life

4) There must be a subject matter to which it relates

### Types of Right

- Social - Civil - Human - Fundamental

- Contractual - Natural

Fundamental Rights: are rights chosen by the state. Chapter IV of CFRN 1999

Natural Rights: are generally inherent and inalienable right. Considered very important to human dignity. They include Right to life, Right to dignity, Right to security.

Civil Rights: Rights conferred by law to protect individuals from government actions. Right to equality, freedom of speech, Right against discrimination (Rights given to people which help them to protect themselves against intimidation)

Affirmative action - is a response to intimidation which civil rights seeks to prevent.

Property Rights - Right to control of tangible and intangible assets (digital space)

Human Rights - They are universal Rights fundamental for human being e.g. Right to health care

Contractual Rights - Rights that arise by virtue of contract

### Sources of Rights

Human Nature

Constitution and Various Statutes

Common Laws

Customary Laws

Religious laws

### Principles of Rights

Principle of individuality - There, rights are inter-connected and inter-dependent.

Article 1: Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (2007) - It held that economic, social, and cultural rights are inter-related to human dignity.

2) It must be coincidental with the principle of universality. Principle of universality: If it applies to Nigerian student, all Nigerian students should benefit. It applies equally to all members of class. It applies to

3) Rights apply equally to all individuals. Principle of equality: (within the class concerned)

4) Principle of inalienability of Rights Each of them is of ultimate importance. You cannot remove one. All of them are tied and fixed to the person / human life. Hajiya V Govt of Imo State (2013) - emphasizes over and above the Principle of Individuality, the primacy of inalienability of natural rights. Rights can't be taken away in surrender etc. E.g. You can't waive your right to life!

Principle of equality → Rights are enjoyed without discrimination. (Uganda v. E. Z. 2012) This case affirms the equality of all persons before the law.

## 18th December 2025 - Fr. Maurice

### Consequences of Rights

1) A Right generally relates to the ability to modify a state of affairs in relations to persons having co-relative duties or the advantage of the holders of the right. E.g. because I have a right to life, that right modifies the action of the other person so that to me e.g. you can't point a gun at me or you can't behave in a way that is harmful to me.

2) The existence of a legal right implies an existence of co-relative duty. (This comes from the definition of rights and duties.)

A legal right must have its existence and exercise guaranteed and recognized by law. (Positive law).

### Theories of Rights

1) Benefit Theory

2) Will / Choice Theory

3) Expectation Theory

1) Benefit Theory: It gives benefit to the holder of the right. A right confers some distinct or separate benefit on holders of such right. The holders enjoy special advantages not enjoyed by non-holders. This theory focuses on the benefit conferred. Critics: Rights are spoken of even where benefit accrues to 3rd parties e.g. The rule of Privity of Contract where such contracts exists for the benefit of 3rd parties.

2) Will / Choice Theory: Hohfeld is the propounder of this theory. The choice theory is a fabric of the benefit theory. Many state that it is

a. It may be said a person has a right because the law gives him some benefit of the right.

b. For him, a person has a right if in addition to the above, the right is benefit. The following three things must be possible:

1) The holder of the right must have the power to choose whether or not to have a duty that arises as a result of such right.

2) If you have and wanted the duty, the holder must have notice to choose either to enforce a breach or threatened breach of this right or not to enforce it.

3) If he was chosen to enforce the holder must have the choice to waive a duty to pay compensation.

Summary: Freedom of choice is the hallmark of legal rights.

Weakness of this theory: There are cases where rights are not subject to choice.

a) Legal duty it powers to provide adequate care to minor.

b) Consent of a minor

c) Constitutional Right - Fundamental Right

3) Expectancy Theory: It arose from the American Scandinavian Realist: For them, a person can be said to have a right, if he/she has a reasonable expectation that the right will be upheld and respected by the society or her institution. CRITIC OF THIS THEORY: To think of right as an expectation misses the point. It is constituted in the wider and is recognized by the society. It also imposes duty on people to respect such right.

### Classes Of Right

1) Imperfect & Perfect Right: Salmond, classified this. He said, perfect rights are recognized and enforceable by law. Imperfect rights are recognized but are not enforceable by money lenders are the only people that can lend money with interest.

a) Every transaction on land must be written in Statute of Fraud - where it is not written, you have lost only the right to enforceability.

b) A contract required to be in writing, but it is not in writing. You've lost right to enforceability.

CRITIC. Once a right is recognized by law it should be a perfect right for all intent and purposes.

2) Public & Private Right. Public rights are rights created by the state for the benefit of the public. Private rights are rights created by the state in individuals and exist for the benefit of the individuals of contract rights. b) rights of a holder of a C. of O. to enforce a subject matter is a right created by the state but the holder can create a right in respect of a subject matter.

3) Positive & Negative Rights! Positive rights consists of benefits a person is entitled to from persons who have a co-relative duty. It consists of positive benefits (a direct benefit), a person's entitled to from a person who has a co-relative duty.

Negative rights consists of benefits by a person not being interfered with by another person who has a co-relative duty. Thou shall not kill.

Who has a co-relative duty not to harm you.

* Concerning the same subject matter, positive rights and negative rights can be created in favour of the same person.

* Positive rights are rights in personam and determinant personable negative rights are rights in rem.

4) Principal Rights & Accessory Rights: Principal rights are rights standing on their own leg and are complete. They derive directly from the subject matter to which they relate e.g. Right of the owner of a property. It is complete in the sense that no other thing is needed to make ownership stand on its two legs.

* An accessory Right is incidental to the Principal Right e.g. lease.

The argument here is that the existence of accessory right is held to the principal right e.g.

a) Right of the ownership of property under a lease.

The lessee has an accessory right.

b) Right of easement (Right of way)

3) Rights In Rem & Rights In Personam:

* Rights in Rem are rights that are enforceable against the whole world.

* Rights in personam are rights that are enforceable against definite persons or individuals.

4) Rights In Re Propria & Rights In Re Aliena

Rights in Re-aliena is a right which limits or derogates from a more general right vested in another person in respect of the same subject matter.

Rights in Re-Propria is right whose scope and enjoyment has been limited by the right in Re-aliena.

The Landlord Right is in Re-propria while the tenant right is in Re-aliena.

5) Vested Rights And Contingent Rights:

Vested Rights are rights which have been properly constituted and enjoyment is available in person or persons on whom the right is vested.

Every legal requirement for the enjoyment of the right has been complied with.

Contingent Right - something is having to be done. That is, having something remaining that has not been done.

The right of an assignee of a property whose assignment is legal and has complied with the Land Use Act is vested Right.

It is contingent where the governor's consent has not been obtained.

8) LEGAL AND EQUITABLE RIGHTS.

* Legal rights are rights recognized by law. It is general rights in Rem which is enforceable against the whole world.

* Equitable rights are rights in Personam recognized by Common Law. Equitable are unknown to law but are recognized and protected by the Court of Chancery. Legal and equitable rights aim to protect individuals' interest. They differ from origin. Equity has more attachment to Conscience and Cons of Chancery, while legal rights originated

Remedies available for the enforcement are different

e.g. of equitable Right: Injunction, Specific performance, estoppel

### Proprietary And Personal Right

* Proprietary rights are rights that relate to a person's property or estate. They are rights that are generally transferable.

* Personal Rights relate to person's status and his personal duties are included such personal rights and duties are generally not transferable.

* Aggregate of a man's proprietary rights constitute of his estate, a set of property

* Aggregate of a man's personal rights is his status or personal condition as opposed to his estate, rank or is not transferable

### Concept of Justice

Why does a state exist?

St. Augustine tells the essence of a state. Justice being taken away, what are kingdoms but great robberies.

According to Thomas Hobbes, man was brutal, unfriendly, addressing wrongs arbitrarily. As a result of these, there was need to save man and there was an agreement to come together and form a group known as a State Pact.

An agreement for man and members of the state to subject to the state. When Justice is taken away, the sole essence of state fails.

Social order is the essence of law. So, order is the moral base of the community.

Justice is the basis of social contract and existence of the state.

Edmund Burke → for more than 200 years, Justice rule has been wasted just in an attempt to define Justice. According to

him. Justice is not without shape.

Ul pian: Justice is the constant and perpetual will to render to every man his due.

Cicero: Justice is the constant and perpetual will to allot to every man his due.

Plato: to mind one's business and not to be a busybody is what it means by Just. This definition came from Common wealth analysis.

Justice is the innate element to permanently render to a person what is due.

Aristotle and A. V. Dicey: Justice means equality. Justice presupposes that all men are equal and must be treated alike. Elements of equality is seen in distributive Justice.

In Chapter IV of 1999 CFRN, an element of equality but unfortunately there is no absolute equality because in Sec 308 of CFRN it contains persons who are exempt. Ongomwa V IGP, Gami Tawerimmi V IGP

Medin Teun Rig vtd V Adesina (2005) 1 NWLR (Pt 927) 937 at pg 461

Herbert Spencer says Justice from the point of freedom. Man is born free but everywhere is in chains. Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

According to Herbert Spencer Right of freedom is an inalienable right bestowed on man, but however, there is no absolute freedom because a person's freedom ends where another's right begins.

Hans Kelsen Justice according to rationality. Anything done in accordance to sound reasoning is Justice But sound reasoning is relative. He said that Justice is the irrational preferences of their protagonists. As everyone defined it in his own.

### Perspectives on Justice

Justice And Common Good

This means that Justice means anything that could give the highest or greatest satisfaction to the greatest number of people. The Justice is derived from the utilitarian satisfaction of goods.

Common good here is any act that will ensure the maximum of satisfaction of the people.

Land Use Act came into being to satisfy the interest of the majority of the state. Land was held in the hand of communities. Ensure that the state people enjoy the use of land.

The element of common goods is that the element of satisfying the state is accomplished in a distributive manner.

Justice According To The Law (Legal Justice). Here, Justice is any act done in any decision taken according to the law.

3) Justice And Security (Thomas Hobbes)

According to Hobbes, the sole and basic of social contracts is to secure man. Social Security means justice. In present Nigeria, civil security is seen to be justice.

4) Justice And Equality (Aristotle & A.V. Dicey) According to Rousseau generally, equality is an inalienable right because it is bestowed on man from creation. To Aristotle, the law must protect the element of equality and in protecting it, certain rights are given to freedom from discrimination.

5) Justice And Freedom (Rousseau) To him, man is born free but everywhere in chains. Freedom here means a state of liberty, a state of lack of restriction, a state of no limitation. This is enshrined in Chapter IV of our 1999 CFRN. Unfortunately, there is no absolute freedom. The sense of being right freedom is restricted in situations where it can bring hardship on someone. Law at determination is an check to this.

### Administration of Justice in Nigeria

In the administration of Justice in Nigeria we have a) Distributive Justice b) Procedural Justice c) Retributive Justice d) Corrective and Restorative Justice

Distributive Justice: It comes in areas of allocation and distribution of common wealth of the society. The common resources must be allocated to members equally without limitation. However, it is not always that equality in distribution occurs, there are situations of arbitrariness. Where there is arbitrariness, corrective justice comes in.

Corrective Justice: Rectifies the wrongs committed under distributive Justice

Procedural Justice: This ensures that in undertaking an act, it is done in accordance with Justice and fairness. This is seen in the Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Act, etc.

Retributive Justice: This deals with punishment for offences. The punishment must be commensurate with the offence committed.

Corrective or Restorative Justice: This is aimed at correcting the wrong done and restoring the victim to the position he was before the wrong was done.

### Hohfeld's Jural Theory

How can we better understand the concept of jurisprudence?

This is because some concepts may not have a clear and concise definition. What a concept is or what it is not?

Hohfeld limited the concepts of rights

- Claim Rights

- Power

- Privilege / liberty

- Immunity

The sub-categories of claimed rights

1) Rights

2) Power

3) Privilege / liberty

4) Immunity

Hohfeld is coming from a diagrammatic point of view.

## Theories of Duties

1) Imperative Theory: This simply means that duties are commanded. Duty comes into being as long as it is commanded by a person or higher authority and imposed on the subject to comply with it. e.g. President to citizens, Doctors to Patients. (Higher to lower authority)

2) Sanction Theory of Duty: This seeks to base the existence of duty on the sanction attached to it. Even if a higher authority gives a command and no sanction is given then a duty is not existing. Sanction and Duty go hand in hand. Fear of punishment

3) Acceptance Theory: This is based mainly on the acceptance of the Public. This theory bases the existence of duty on the acceptance of such duty by the community, whose patterns of behaviour the duty regulates. Here the people must accept it. Even if it is commanded by a higher authority/law, and it is sanctioned, but the people refuse to accept it, there is no duty. It exists if duty passes the criteria of existence, then it is accepted.

Community accepts it or complies with the criteria set out by the same community.

Note: Find out the criticisms given to these theories.

The sanction theory criticizes the acceptance theory by saying that if people accept the duty while it has not been sanctioned, how can there be a duty? If it is not sanctioned, people will behave anyhow they want to.

A response to the criticism of acceptance theory by sanction is a meta-ethical stance and stated that judges give judgements without sanctions (declaratory judgement). Also, in provisions of statutes, an offence is defined without providing sanctions to them.

4) Feeling Theory of Duty: Here, there is a relationship between the existence of duty and inner feeling of someone to obey that duty. This theory is related to psychology.

Basis of the existence of duty: Important Notice.

Then where does the existence of duty arise? Origin of the impulse of duty. Where it comes from?

Emmanuel Kant, Propounder of the feeling Theory. He brought about categorical imperative, also known as the principle of humanity. To him, humanity must always act in such a way that the maxim (principle) of their action can be held in such a way that they are the recipient of that action.

The theory of feeling of duty asserts that there is an inner connection between the existence of duty and inner feeling of people which compels them to obey the law.

There is also a criticism for this theory- A Person may not have a feeling to perform such duty, that does not mean that such duty does not exist. e.g.

Sec 305 of Criminal Code- Penalty for committing suicide.

The critics say that why say that the origin of duty is feeling here where there is still some sort of sanction that is

1) Considerable interest is feeling as two separate things

2) Breaks down to the view feeling

3) Reducing to obey certain rules set by the state e.g traffic rules. Human beings have reason and will.

Basic of obedience to actual

Factors that relate to immediate obedience to duty

1) Fear basis - Command / Sanctions

2) Social basis - Linked to Acceptance Theory

3) Psychological basis - Linked to feeling Theory

4) Moral Basis - Linked to feeling Theory

John Austin, stipulated that the fear basis is linked to the sanctions and Command theory of duty. He stated that presence of sanctions compels obedience. The critics say that it is not a formal basis; many obey because they are thus arbitrary without fear of the consequence of not abiding. There are also critics that state that there are duties that are not based on sanction. Fear has no place in some labouries where duties are breached due to accidents.

2) Social Basis Inter-dependent patterns of behaviour in the society. Behaviour patterns are inter-related. This is linked to the acceptance theory of Durkheim.

3) Psychological Basis Here, obedience to duty is a psychological reaction. Either there is a fear or a social basis that prevents such person from doing such action. There is a psychological pressure to obey such duties due to the ever present pressure to obey the duty.

4) Moral Basis Obedience to duty is traceable to the presence of moral obligations on the part of rational persons to obey a particular duty. Here, it is about what you "ought to do" and "ought not to do" This is clear since damages are not sanctioned and where people decide why it is to obey such duty. And may comply with it goes with their moral sensitivity and also based in their conscience

a. Ratio Decidendi - Reason for the decision of the case

b. Obiter Dictum - Things said by the way to non-binding judicial comments

## 16th December 2025 - Prof. Uju Nwogu

### Judicial Precedent

Theories of Judicial Precedent

1) Classical Theory

2) Hamburgh Mechanical Theory

3) American Realistic Theory

4) Goodhart's Theory

Classical Theory: Here, the principle which the case is binding authority is to be found in the reasons given by the precedent judge for his decision i.e. what he said. The judge's statement is binding only so far as it is necessary to the decision of the case. An observation on other matters or statements of law are mere obiter dicta and not binding at all.

Mostly followed by English Courts. The theory does not help in practice to actually identify the ratio. Where the judge gives two reasons for his decision, both are binding. See Jacobs v LCC

Also consider the facts of the case to consider the reason for the decision

2) Hamburgh's Mechanical Theory According to this theory to discover the ratio of a case i.e. the reason for which the judge decides the case one should carry out the following:

i) State the reason why the judge based his decision

ii) Insert one word that reverses the meaning of the proposition (NOT / or any form of reversal)

iii) Then ask if the court could have reached the same decision between both parties if it rested on the altered proposition

If the decision would be same, then the supposed reason cannot be real or the true reason for the decision. The ratio decidendi will not stand.

Criticism: It is difficult to formulate a proposition of law which can be completely reversed with just inserting one word?

2) Where there are two ratios, the theory is of no assistance.

3) Where the ratio is wide the theory will not be applied.

This theory is generally used by trial judges.

3) American Realistic Theory: This is divided into two broad groups. They are a) The extreme group: This group rejects the doctrine of precedent altogether. Stating that the judge's statements about being bound by precedent are part of the reason why these judges make decisions the way they make radical decisions or decisions that are not within the provisions of the law.

b) The moderate Group: Here, the subsequent courts are bound by precedent, but differ from classical theory. According to them, to find the principle which subsequent courts will follow one disregards the reason given by the Judge and bases only on what he does; that is, the decisions between the parties in relation to the facts of the case. Whenever the facts of a later case is similar to the precedent case, one expects the same decision.

Goodhart's Theory: Here, the principle binding on subsequent courts is to be derived from the judge's decision in the light of the facts which the judge treated as material. Goodhart's theory was between the English and American Theories. The judge determines which part is material and immaterial.

This is basically the best theory.

Question: Which of the facts are material as determined by the judge?

Rules To follow:

1) Express statement by the judge that certain facts are material or immaterial, and they must be treated as such. Even if the judge in his statement of facts is wrong, then the material facts must be taken as stated by him.

2) If the judge treats any facts as impliedly material or immaterial, they should be accepted as such.

3) Where as between material and immaterial facts, there is no distinction possible, all the facts mentioned by the judge are to be treated as being material. The more the facts that are included, the narrower the resultant principle of law will be.

4) Where several opinions reach the same conclusion but differ on material facts, only those facts held to be material by the majority are to be regarded. (Majority carries the vote)

5) Where, as between material and immaterial facts stated in the several opinions of judges, no distinction is possible, all the facts mentioned by each of the judges are to be treated as material.

6) Hypothetical facts, if the judge states a fact hypothetically, such fact is not material and does not influence the principle of the case

* Goodhart's theory seems to be the most reliable of all theories on how to find the ratio decidendi of a case, yet there is no evidence that judges use it.

* The theory does not assist in knowing when facts are impliedly material or immaterial

### Advantages of the Doctrine of Stare Decisis

1) It helps to maintain consistency, stability and a high degree of certainty in the practice of the courts. Example: N. T. Canada.

2) It saves the judges time and energy since they don't need to trace every point of law in previous cases.

3) It enforces a welcome uniformity of standards among the decisions among inferior courts, especially

4) It enhances public confidence in the judiciary that like cases will always be decided alike in like circumstances

5) It permits the lower courts to refuse to follow a precedent decision of the higher court except the Supreme Court which has been reached per incuriam.

### Disadvantages Of Stare Decisis

1) The doctrine has the tendency of perpetuating bad decisions and obsolete laws and the fact that a lower court can't refuse to follow a precedent decision of the Supreme Court in a matter that has been reached per incuriam compounds the problem

2) It is unhealthy in that it prevents lower courts from re-interpreting statutes and thus produces unnecessary rigidity in this area of the law

3) Judges do make law and not just interpret

### Duty

Note: Exams

* Consider each basis independently and make your argument on which is the strongest

* Explain them to show you understand them clearly

* Having explained them, you can now state one you feel is strongest and then give your reasons

* Tell him why you think it, for example feel that basis 2 is stronger than the other basis. Make sure you state that and then conclude.

* Classes of Duty

* Explain how a universal duty can end up being a particular duty as well

* A class of duty can fall into another class e.g duty to

### Classes of Duty

Universal/General/Particular Duty

In Universal, everybody is expected to perform this duty e.g duties that are for the whole citizens of Nigeria.

While general duties are imposed on specific classes of persons e.g in Nigeria if all persons are required to perform certain duties to the state, they are universal. But there could be a class of Nigerians doing business or aliens who are in Nigeria that are subject to Nigerian laws. It is not to the entire people of Nigeria but to a particular section of people.

For Particular Duty, it is a duty that is owed from person to person.

The Universal is Larger, General is more constrained while Particular is strictly Person to Person.

For example, the various duties imposed on Nigerians by the 1999 Constitution are all Universal Duties. Every single person is bound by it.

Duties imposed on aliens (foreigners) who want to do business in Nigeria, all have General duties (they are in class within Nigeria.

Particular Duties are those duties that arise from specific relations of the law, e.g the duty of care not to allow 3rd parties to suffer damages as a result of one's negligent acts.

e.g A Doctor owes a Patient a duty of care

Primary And Sanctioning Duties

A general, universal or particular duty can be a Primary or Sanctioning duty.

Primary Duties, these do not arise from commission of wrongs, while Sanctioning is from the commission of wrongs e.g Sanctions given after owing someone

Primary duties are duties expressible in law which do not arise after a primary duty has been breached e.g. Right of life. This is a general. Sanctioning duties are those imposed as a result of a previous crime committed or as a remedy or way of making up.

Primary Duties are those that don't arise from commission of crime. They are independent from any breach of duty, e.g. Duty of a Police man to prevent the commission of a felony. See Sec 4 of the Police Act. Duties of a lecturer or a Professor is a Primary Duty.

But when there is a sanction attached to such duty e.g. When a lecturer or professor collects bribe from anyone, a 2 months suspension is given by the disciplinary committee. The above duty is predicated on the commission of a previous crime/offense.

Sanctioning Duties on the other hand are as a result of wrongs already committed. e.g an unsuccessful defendant in a civil action has the duty to pay the successful plaintiff his

### Law and Morality

The two terms are relative and normative in nature. They are bits of morality found in law.

Note

Difference between Law and Morality

Similarities between Law and Morality

Scholar debates on relationship between law and morality <Hart's Rule > <Hart's D >

- Law is a body of rules made by a legislative law making body for the conduct of human beings in the society.

- It is always dynamic

- There is no general definition of morality. Different scholars give their point of views on morality. Ethics is the science of morality. Morality is the idea of what is wrong and what is good.

- This may vary from person to person

Morality is anything what is bad and any what is good

### Difference between Law and Morality

1) Divergence

Morality stresses moral knowledge while law is concerned with actions Morality begins with the mind

2) Morality emphasizes the role of individual but law is based on social interaction

3) Morality emphasizes duty whereas law emphasizes both duties and rights

4) An individual may reject the demands of morality but is bound to accept the dictates of the law

5) Law is stated in precise terms while morality is often stated in wide terms

6) The use of morality appeal to the conscience of individuals while the rules of law must be complied with, understanding the conscience of the individuals

7) The enforcement of moral laws depends on the social and psychological presence of the community while that of laws depends on the external forces put in place by the state.

8) The rule of morality is persuasive while the rule of law is coercion.

### Similarities Between Law and Morality

1) Coercion?

Despite the identified differences between the two concepts, there are still some similarities.

3, 4, 6 (same)

Moral similarities between the two

1) There is always a moral duty to obey the law and where the law runs contrary to moral laws, moral arguments can be adduced to press for changes through legislation

2) Both systems are concerned with imposing certain standards of conduct (i.e. both law and morality are normative).

3) Moral codes supplement the force of law (human equality forbids them by recognizing that we ought generally to refrain from such acts).

4) The moral duty to obey the law is generally accepted and plays an important role in establishing the authority of the law and ensuring obedience to it without actual reliance to coercive measures.

5) There is similarity of normal of language (that is they learn the same first language?)

6) Legal obligations are created in human society by laws and by because the law operates with the purview of some basic moral norms acceptable in the society.
